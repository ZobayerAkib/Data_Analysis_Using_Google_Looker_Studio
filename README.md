# Data Analysis Projects using Google Looker Studio

Welcome to the Data Analysis Projects repository. This repository showcases data analysis projects developed using Google Looker Studio. Each project aims to extract key features from datasets and deliver actionable insights through detailed visualization and analysis. These insights support data-driven decision-making and emphasize clarity and depth in presenting complex data patterns.
## Project 1: Book E-commerce Review Analysis

This project presents a comparative analysis of book review data from four different e-commerce websites. It includes:
- **Review Count and Average Rating**: Visual comparisons of the total number of reviews and the average rating per site.
- **Book-Wise Rating Breakdown**: A bar chart representation of individual book ratings across the four e-commerce sites.

This is a small practice project to explore and demonstrate Looker Studio's capabilities in visualizing and analyzing data.
